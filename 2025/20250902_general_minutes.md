### General Membership Meeting
#### Pillow Elementary School Library


6:35 PM- 
Meeting begins, Rosanna Martinez introduces folks, overviewing the map of NSCNA.  Going over the agenda.
6:38 PM- Mike Siegel begins speaking, overviewing District 7.  Best engaged district, most recycling.  MikeSiegelD7 on social media.  There is a newsletter with about 5000 folks subscribed.  The Siegel office includes several people: Chief of Staff, Emily G; Zoning specialist; Sarah S.; Heidi Sloane (sp?).  Cap & Stitch program passed, Siegel was opposed.  $100 M in caps and stitches was settled upon, $400 M had been proposed.  Discontinued the License Plate Reader program, which had issues with data privacy.  

6:45 PM- 
Mike Siegel is describing the 2 months of the budget cycle.  The city started with a deficit of $34 M, many federal programs were cut.  Tax rate increase has been proposed (TRE), requires voter approval– $0.05/100 of home valuation, approximately $200 / year increase for the median home.  Affordability has been voiced as a top concern.  The TRE will be on the Nov. 2 ballot.  Cleaning the bathrooms at parks.  Firefighter overtime was slated to be cut, and the TRE would avoid those cuts.  Rental assistance and affordable housing programs.  Public Safety and emergency response: “brownouts for EMS” meaning that the emergency response could not be staffed at the desired level.  Many 911 calls are “low acuity” e.g. not a heart attack.  There is a way to tailor the approach to the care needed.  Siegel will be knocking on doors to encourage voters to pass this TRE.  City Council meetings will continue.

6:54 PM- 
CM Siegel is describing oversight in the city.  Burnet Road bike paths, beacons, etc.  North Lamar is somewhat under-resourced and has many crashes and dangerous roads.  North Lamar is in some portions a TXDOT maintained road.  A $20 M bond was approved pre-Covid to improve North Lamar, only $1 M was spent.  Costs have increased since then.  Drainage is another concern, with flash-flood-prone areas.  Arroyo Seco needs potentially $50 M to prevent flooding.  Concludes the speaking portion at 6:58 PM.

6:58 PM- 
Q&A Begins.  
Q: “How are you going to support the Cap and Stitch program despite being opposed to it initially?”  $106+ M in construction was approved for a set number of caps and stitches.  May be other mechanisms are there to increase funding for these programs.  Dallas put in 10% of the cost for their program, Austin has already put in 30%.  The decks may be an option.  What is the willingness of voters to tax ourselves.  

Q: “Civic lesson in taxes– federal versus local versus state, etc.”  Recapture taxes cities and redistributes to rural areas.  General fund versus “enterprise” fund.  

7:05 PM- 
Q: “Question about food– free and reduced lunch programs, federal cuts may threaten these programs. A food bond may help?”  CM Siegel: Food equity, two initiatives: Central Texas Food Bank, City will fund 30 food pantries.  Many schools with “Parent Support Specialists” will get a pantry.  First results appear promising.  Now discussing land use for food: park land, and other seemingly unconventional places to grow food.  

7:09 PM-
Q:“There appears to be an oversupply of some new housing with many vacant new builds.” City’s population decreased last year.  There appears to be a saturation of available market rate units.  The goal was 20,000 units of below market rate units, only 400 have been built.  The City will need to take an active role to generate below-market-rate housing.  

7:11 PM-
Q: “{involved some numbers, difficult to hear}” This is the best choice the council can make.  

7:13 PM- 
Q: “How can we help?” Pick an issue or project and engage.  Not a lot of people come to City Hall.  Cadence is ~every 2 weeks.  Siegel departs.

7:15 PM-
