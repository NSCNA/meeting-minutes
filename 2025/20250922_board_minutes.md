Neighborhood Garage Sale (5:34 PM)
Katie Lee discussing Neighborhood Garage Sale.  This Saturday from 8AM - 3PM.  TODO: hand over the Instagram to Erin T.  It’s being advertised on Craigslist.  We need to put the yard signs up, Josh has the Garage Sale yard signs, roughly 6 - 10 of them.  Recommended to put them on Burnet and Anderson and Steck main intersections.  Pam wants to do voter registration at someone’s house this weekend.

Zeffy
Rosanna mentions the prospect of using Zeffy for advertising the Garage Sale.  Josh mentions that Ryan is interested helping with the Zeffy.  There appears to be some friction with whether auto-renewals are working.  

Nominating committee
The Vice President appoints committee chairs, they do not need to be on the board.  The Nominating committee is in charge of board of directors.  Rosanna describes a goal to recruit members, desire to use “Buy Nothing” as a platform for connecting to new members and advertising, but a tradeoff of what the boundaries are. 
Action Item: Brainstorm narrowly specific needs (e.g. Instagram help) to call out.

National Night Out, 7th October
Erin describes how National Night Out works.  Proposal to look at it for 2026.

Next general membership meeting Nov 4
Costs have gone up for the Pillow Library: ~$150 instead of ~$40.  Board agrees to accept the higher costs, no clear alternative.


Pillow Camp Champions
Kathy Rudd and PTA is asking to provide backstop funding of $1k - $2k. We are discussing providing the funding.  Money that the NSCNA spends must be in our mission.  Is educational scholarship within our mission?  Must have a response for this question.    There are some questions about the structure of the “backstop funding”.  Board unclear on straight cash contributions.  We agree there are non-monetary ways to contribute to the PTA, perhaps joint events, advertising, helping them set up Zeffy and organization.  We have PTA attending the Roots & Wings event, prospect of selling balloons.  Banners are being printed.  Discussion of using banner space as a source of fundraising.

Garden
We are having “It’s My Park Day”, via Austin Parks Foundation.  Mulching and Picnic Table construction.  More work days in the future.  There is talk about extending the Garden.  We are applying for that project in the Spring.  Creek Cleanup Days and Pillow Park Work days are separate and related activities.  The event is starting at 8AM.  Signs, coffee, and tacos.  

John Anderson asks for clarification on how the Garden committee operates.  Josh encourages folks to read the bylaws on the website.  Community Garden is part of the NSCNA and has its own bank account.  It has a “sponsored fund” account, which means Austin Parks Foundation manages the bank account for the Community Garden.  When the gardener’s pay the monthly fees, the funds go to the APF earmarked for the NSC community garden.  Expenses for the garden go back to the members of the Garden Committee by requests to Austin Parks Foundation.

Proposed Improvements and expansion of the Garden (6:20 PM)
The school is going to require the community garden security be managed by the school.  There are open questions about how the school and community manage access to the garden.  Community garden is not allowed to be used during school hours.  There is an option to register as a volunteer which may be a possibility.  

Roots & Wings
Katie and Anna will be out of town for Roots & Wings Fest.  Seeking volunteers to set up the event.  Josh encourages folks to use the “social@” nscna.org.  Josh describes the givepulse app, which allows us to records folks’ volunteer hours.  We will get access to givepulse through Austin Parks Foundation.  We are going through Deborah’s list she sent out at 2:07 PM today.  DJ/MC available from Pillow.  

Dog waste on the Park at Pillow
Long email thread about this.  Austin Parks is focused on this issue.
