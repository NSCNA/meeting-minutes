Meeting starts.  Roots and wings recap.  John helped to MC, lots of activities and crafts.  Snow cones, tree information and more.  PTA was there, with large presence.  Not as large as July 4th event, but in part due to it being the first annual.  Josh and Clarissa did a gardening demo, met several folks.  Deborah says we need to give a report to the organizers of Roots & Wings, approximately 50 attendees.  

6:13 PM
Amelia Cobb is giving an update on the Contact Team, she will be interim chair of the contact team.  Neighborhood plan amendments and modifications must go through the “Contact Team”.  Some interest in re-zoning a particular parcel. Last time the team met was 3 years ago.  The team is now meeting.  They are discussing this zoning with a lawyer named David Hartman (sp?) who is representing the property owners. The city planning/zoning commission is involved in a step in November.  There are requirements for the contact team to be active.  The next meeting will be with the Lawyer next Wednesday the 29th.  The contact team is distinct from the NSNCA.  Per the NSCNA bylaws, the contact team needs to have a general meeting in November, tentatively slated for November ~13 at the Pillow Library.  The Contact Team wants to present at the November 4th NSCNA General Membership Meeting.  Kevin Weir expressed interest.  Question from Amelia Cobb is who is in charge of the Development Committee, (Erin Thompson).  Val Benevidez may also be a good contact.  Lawyer is presenting the development as a potentially multi-family but the current zoning is industrial.  It’s located on the Access Road, on the other side of the railroad tracks.  It’s not possible to walk to our neighborhood, it is physically separated.  

The zoning height request is 180 ft, 15-18 stories, current limit is 75 ft.
Question: “Why would we want that here?”  Josh responds.  We have to decide what the benefit is.  The group are all discussing the scenarios, pros and cons for our neighborhood and potential new neighbors.  
We are wrapping up conversation at 6:42 PM.
