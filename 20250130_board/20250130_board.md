### 6:36 Meeting Start
Board members introduce themselves

Discussing how to get "Quickbooks Online"  need a license.  We believe there is a way to get a discount.  Total assets exceed $39k.  Income is about 30:30:30 advertising:dues:contributions.  We are going through a paper printout of the budget.  Large events cost were $3280.

*Action item:* Each committee should put together a budget for what they want to do.  We are jumping to the topic of Nissan.  There is some discussion of asking Nissan about how to use the funds.  Discussing using the funds for the "Allandale Estates" Sign.  Josh Conrad has some written records, Steven has verbal recollection.  Rosanna and John are interested in approaching Town North to ask.  

### 6:52 PM Moving to social committee
Katie Lee-- no "grand plan" at the moment, still evaluating.  Rosanna asks about 
- "Aquapolooza", a former Summer event hosted at Pillow, may go back to circa 2014.  
- Hosting events at "Waterloo", could be an initiative to host Trivia event there.    
- Initiative: "neighborhood-wide" bulk pickup before the Garage Sale, since Austin Resource Recovery has moved towards "on-demand bulk pickup", instead of scheduled.  May be a nice newsletter article.  
- Halloween event with "haunted house" should expand on that.  
- Steven reports we used to have "Yard of the month"


### Happenings in the neighborhood  
- "Care committee" initiative?  Or maybe just newsletter.
