Minutes
-------

1. Approve March Board Meeting minutes  
5:37 PM We approved the minutes.  Amendment to last month's minutes: Steven's name is not one them.

2. Pillow park access and fencing update  
The park access is locked on certain sides, there is still access, but it may not be clear how to get in.  We are discussing options.  Folks can still get in.  

3. Desired Pillow playground renovations  
Ground cover is coming up through the mulch in the playground area-- it is in a state of disrepair, seems hazardous.  What can be done.  Ask Kat?  Sections are overgrown.  Who is responsible-- Pillow or Parks and Recreation?  Discussing AISD.

4. Feedback on 2025 plan from neighbors
Budget was approved, April 1 General meeting went well.

5. Sponsorship package
Ways for businesses to get involved--news letter, silent auction.  Physical membership card.  Booths/presence at neighborhood events.  Sell sponsorship banners on the new fence.  El Dorado and other restaurants may be interested, for example.  Idea: pricing tiers on a one-page PDF.  Who would take on the sponsorship management.  Discussing physical card: tactile benefits of a card, drawback of having to maintain the physical card (do we print them out).  Idea: make the welcome email have "member card" that is printable.  

6. Membership Drive and “first year free” option

7. Zeffy rollout plan
Zeffy accepts payments with no fees.  Push notifications.  Idea: make the welcome email have "member card" that is printed out.
